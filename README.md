# Task Manager

This is my very first web application with a functioning backend. Throughout this process I learned a lot of the common practices when writing server side code using Express JS and Node JS. After this small project I can confidently say I understand the basics of Express and Node, along side HTTP methods, routes, middleware, etc.
